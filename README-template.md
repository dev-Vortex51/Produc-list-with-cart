### What I learned

Using styled-components and global styles helped me maintain consistency across the project by defining reusable CSS variables in the :root selector. This approach made it easy to manage colors, fonts, and other styling properties throughout the application. For example, I structured my global styles as follows:

```js
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
  :root {
    --primary-color: hsl(14, 86%, 42%);
    --background-light: hsl(20, 50%, 98%);
  }

  body {
    background-color: var(--background-light);
    font-family: 'Red Hat Text', sans-serif;
  }
`;

export default GlobalStyles;
```

### Continued development

One area I want to continue focusing on in future projects is state management and performance optimization in React. While using the Context API for managing the cart state worked well, I want to explore more advanced solutions like Redux Toolkit or Zustand for better scalability. Additionally, optimizing re-renders using useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo is something I aim to refine. For example, using useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in event handlers:
